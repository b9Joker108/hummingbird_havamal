When I last searched for this dissertation a few years ago, I couldn't find it. I am overjoyed today at coming by it through the grace of Shrimati Serendipity, whilst performing an Internet browser search on: "chnospinci". Peirce is one of my personal heroes and Semiotic Theory and signification were so transformative to my Worldview when I studied a few units of Linguistics the second time of the three I have ventured an undergraduate degree and as I have used all runesets, commencing with the Elder from circa fourteen (14) years old: to have my hands on this work brings me waves of delight.
